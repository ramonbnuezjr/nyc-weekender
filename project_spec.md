## 📋 **Project Overview**

## One-liner
A clean, Google-like chat UI that can answer NYC-local questions (starting with: "What's going on in Central Park this weekend?") and returns real events from NYC Open Data plus weather context.

## v0 Scope (tight)
- **APIs**: Google Gemini (LLM), OpenWeatherMap (weather), NYC Open Data (events).
- **Question types supported** (initial):
  1) "What's the weather in Central Park this weekend?"
  2) "What's going on in Central Park this weekend?" → real events from NYC Parks data.
  3) "What should I plan for Central Park this weekend?" → events + weather-aware suggestions.
- **Out of scope for v0**: Third-party event scraping, complex event filtering.
- **UI**: single search box and a compact response card, keyboard-first.

## v0.1 (very small follow-up)
- Add **NYC Parks Events** JSON feed integration
- Weekend filter + Central Park spatial filtering
- "Sources" line with deep links to NYC Open Data
- Enhanced event details and categorization

## KPIs (week 1)
- p50 latency ≤ **2.5s**, p95 ≤ **5s** for a typical query.
- ≥ **80%** "useful" thumbs‑up from 10+ test sessions.
- **≥5 real events** returned for Central Park weekend queries (when available).
- Zero API-key leaks; error rate < **1%** of requests.

## Architecture (v0)
```
[Next.js UI] —> [Edge/Serverless API route] —> [Gemini API]
                                  ├——> [OpenWeatherMap /data/2.5/forecast]
                                  └——> [NYC Open Data Socrata API]
```
- Gemini: intent parse + response synthesis with real event data.
- Weather: fetched server-side; results injected into Gemini prompt as structured context.
- Events: NYC Open Data integration for real Central Park events.

## Prompts (v0)
- **System**: "You are NYC Chat. Be concise. Use real event data when provided. Never hallucinate events; if events are unavailable, say so and offer weather-aware suggestions instead. Focus on Central Park and NYC-specific information."
- **Event Context**: "Based on real NYC Parks events data for Central Park this weekend: {event_data} and weather forecast: {weather_data}, provide helpful recommendations."

## Acceptance Tests (v0)
- **AT-1**: Input: "What's going on in Central Park this weekend?"  
  Output: Returns ≥5 real events from NYC Open Data (if available) with titles, times, and links. No made‑up events.
- **AT-2**: Input: "Weather in Central Park this weekend"  
  Output: Returns min/max temps and precipitation probability for Sat/Sun with human summary.
- **AT-3**: Cold start to first byte ≤ 1.5s on broadband; total ≤ 5s (p95).

## Non‑functional
- Observability: basic logging per request (duration, model, cache hits, anonymized IP/UA).
- Rate limiting: 30 req/min/IP in development.
- Privacy: no PII storage; no analytics beyond aggregate counters.

## Data & APIs
- **Gemini**: use latest suitable "Pro/Flash" chat model; enable JSON output for tool calls.
- **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap `/data/2.5/forecast` with `lat,lon,appid,units=imperial,cnt=40`.
- **Events**: NYC Open Data Socrata API with spatial filtering for Central Park.
- **Time semantics**: "weekend" = next Sat/Sun in America/New_York.
- **Coordinates**: Central Park default `(40.7812, -73.9665)`.

## NYC Open Data Integration
### Core Tables:
1. **Events**: `fudw-fgrp` (event listings, titles, descriptions, start/end times)
2. **Locations**: `cpcm-i88g` (event coordinates, park references)
3. **Park Geometry**: `enfh-gkve` (Central Park polygon for spatial filtering)
4. **Categories**: `xtsw-fqvh` (event types and classifications)

### Query Flow:
1. **Resolve Place**: NYC GeoSearch API → Central Park coordinates
2. **Get Park Polygon**: Query Parks Properties for Central Park boundary
3. **Fetch Events**: Spatial query for events within Central Park polygon
4. **Filter by Time**: Weekend time window (Friday 00:00 → Sunday 23:59)
5. **Join Data**: Event details + location + category information

## Risks → Mitigations
- **Hallucinated events** → hard rule: use only real NYC Open Data; no events in v0 without data.
- **Latency spikes** → cache events by weekend; cache weather by (lat, weekend); stream Gemini tokens.
- **Scope creep** → ship v0 with real events in 48h, then v0.1 enhancements.

## Milestones
- **Day 1**: scaffold Next.js, env plumbing, weather fetcher, NYC Open Data integration, prompt, AT‑2 green.
- **Day 2**: AT‑1 messaging with real events, logging, simple styles, deploy preview.
